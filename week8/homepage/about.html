        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Harvard was founded and authorized by the Massachusetts General Court,
          the governing legislature of colonial-era Massachusetts Bay
          Colony. While never formally affiliated with any Protestant
          denomination, Harvard trained Congregational clergy until its
          curriculum and student body were gradually secularized in the 18th
          century. By the 19th century, Harvard had emerged as the most
          prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston
          elite. Following the American Civil War, under Harvard
          president Charles William Eliot's long tenure from 1869 to 1909,
          Harvard developed multiple professional schools, which transformed it
          into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the
          Association of American Universities. James B. Conant led the
          university through the Great Depression and World War II, and
          liberalized admissions after the war.
